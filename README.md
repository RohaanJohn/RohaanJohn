Hi! My name is Rohaan John.

I am a third year computer science student at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum. I am a back end web developer. I have made Web Applications and APIs using Django Framework.

I also have deep interest in Machine Learning. So far, I learnt how to create sequential models and how to further train them so as to make accurate predictions in different instances. I made projects specifically in the field of image processing and did this using TensorFlow. 

I am familiar with Python, Java and C as well. My aim is to create applications that are unique and beneficial for others.

Currently, I am in the process of learning App Development using Flutter and working on the DhwaniApp.
# ‚≠ê Featured Projects:

## - 1. PurifyNature 
PurifyNature aims at reducing the volume of trash around us. The website is built to pinpoint those areas where trash is accumualted and volunteers can come together and clean up such areas. 

A user takes a photo of a locality where trash is accumulated. After uploading, our AI model will determine whether or not the area is clean. If clean, the user is redirected to the main page or else that particular location is pinpointed. 

The website is built using Django and the predictions are made using Tensorflow. It is hosted on railway.app.

There are still many more features that needs to be added into the website for it to be properly functional but this was just a small start for something that has great potential to grow and be beneficial to the society.

Stay Green & Clean!

## - 2. EmotionAnalysisAPI
Using Django REST Framework, I made an API which determines whether a person in an uploaded image is happy, sad or angry. The API can be used in other apps which need emotion analysis for their operation.

## - 3. AIPoems
In this web app a user can input a theme and then a poem is generated based on the theme and an image as well. The story is generated using ChatGPT and image is generated using DallE.

## - 4. CodedStory
This a Django App which inputs a story theme and generates a very brief story around the theme and an image as well. The story is generated using ChatGPT and image is generated using DallE.

## - 5. ChadBot
ChadBot is a discord bot which is mainly built as a way to interact with APIs from discord. Currently it uses: Zenquote api to send a quote, API Ninjas api to send a fact, ChatGPT api to chat and generate poems/stories and DallE api to generate images.

The command to send a random quote is -inspire and to send a random fact is -fact.

To chat with ChadBot (aka ChadGPT lol) you can use: "ok chad" followed by your sentence. The response is generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. To generate a story and a poem you need to use "story:" and "poem:" respectively followed by your theme you want the text generation of. Along with the text, a DallE generated image will be shown which is relevant with the theme.

Update: Now you can generate songs and articles as well using "song:" and "write:" respectively followed by the theme.

If you want just an image, then use "imagine:" followed by the image you want of.

## - 6. DhwaniApp
DhwaniApp is a Flutter app that aims towards helping children with special needs in their communication process.
I have worked on the AI-API part of the app and am currently in the process of learning Flutter to work on the app side. 
The app is currently under development.
