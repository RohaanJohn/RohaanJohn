Hi! I am a third year computer science student at Mar Baselios College of Engineering Trivandrum. I am a Django developer. I have made REST APIs using Django REST Framework and dynamic websites using Django Web Framework. 

Currently, my interest lies in the field of machine learning. So far, I learnt how to create sequential models and how to further train them so as to make accurate predictions in different instances. I was able to do this using Tensorflow. I am familiar with Python, Java and C as well. My aim is to create applications that are unique and beneficial for others.

# ‚≠ê Featured Projects:

## - EmotionAnalysisAPI
Using Django, specifically Django REST Framework, I made an API which determines whether a person in an uploaded image is happy, sad or angry. The API can be used in other apps which need emotion analysis for their operation.

## - PurifyNatureAPI
Using Django, specifically Django REST Framework, I made an API which determines whether an uploaded picture is Clean or Trash. The API can be used in other apps which need trash detection for their operation.

## - PurifyNature 
PurifyNature aims at reducing the volume of trash around us. The website is built to pinpoint those areas where trash is accumualted and volunteers can come together and clean up such areas. 

A user takes a photo of a locality where trash is accumulated. After uploading, our AI model will determine whether or not the area is clean. If clean, the user is redirected to the main page or else that particular location is pinpointed. 

The website is built using Django and the predictions are made using Tensorflow. It is hosted on Heroku.

There are still many more features that needs to be added into the website for it to be properly functional but this was just a small start for something that has great potential to grow and be beneficial to the society.

## - ChadBot
ChadBot is a discord bot which is maintly built as a way to interact with APIs from discord. Currently it uses zenquote api to send a quote and api-ninjas api to send a fact to a channel every 1 hour. 

The command to send a random quote is -inspire and -help shows the other commands of the bot.

The bot also responds to certain words like sad, unhappy, etc. with custom user inputted encouraging words. Use -list to show all the added encouraging words, -add *word* to add a new word to the list and -delete *position* to delete a word from the list. If you want to turn off autoresponse from the bot use -responding off or use -responding on to turn autoresponse back on.

The link to add the bot to your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=880705578043838464&permissions=227344&scope=bot
