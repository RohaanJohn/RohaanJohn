Hi! I am a second year computer science student at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum. I am a Django and Flutter developer. I am familiar with Python, Dart, Java and C as well. My aim is to create applications that are unique and beneficial to others.

# ‚≠ê Featured Projects:
## - PurifyNature 
PurifyNature aims at reducing the volume of trash around us. The website is built to pinpoint those areas where trash is accumualted and volunteers can come together and clean up such areas. 

A user takes a photo of a locality where trash is accumulated. After uploading, our AI model will determine whether or not the area is clean. If clean, the user is redirected to the main page or else that particular location is pinpointed. There are still many more features that needs to be added into the website for it to be properly functional but this was just a small start for something that has great potential to grow and be beneficial to the society.
