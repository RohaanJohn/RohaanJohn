Hi! My name is Rohaan John. I am a third year computer science student at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum. 

üîπ I am a backend web developer. I have made Web Apps/Websites using the Django Framework.

üîπ I made APIs too using Django's own REST Framework.

üîπ I also have experience in Discord Bot Development. Created a bot using discord.py and hosted it at 
 replit.

üîπ In the field of AI ML, I learnt how to do image processing (for mask/trash detection, emotion analysis) 
 and supervised learning (for mobile phone price prediction).

üîπ I am familiar with both Python and C as well.

My aim is to create applications that are unique and beneficial for others.
Currently, I am in the process of learning App Development using Flutter and working on the DhwaniApp.

# ‚≠ê Featured Projects:

## - 1. PurifyNature 
PurifyNature aims at reducing the volume of trash around us. The website is built to pinpoint those areas where trash is accumualted and volunteers can come together and clean up such areas. 

A user takes a photo of a locality where trash is accumulated. After uploading, our AI model will determine whether or not the area is clean. If clean, the user is redirected to the main page or else that particular location is pinpointed. 

The website is built using Django and the predictions are made using Tensorflow. It is hosted on railway.app.

There are still many more features that needs to be added into the website for it to be properly functional but this was just a small start for something that has great potential to grow and be beneficial to the society.

Stay Green & Clean!

## - 2. PriceWizard
PriceWizard can be used to predict prices of mobile phones yet to release with their features known pre-hand. I used supervised learning methods like KNN, SVR, Logisitic, Linear and RF Regression methods to predict the price.

## - 3. EmotionAnalysisAPI
Using Django REST Framework, I made an API which determines whether a person in an uploaded image is happy, sad or angry. The API can be used in other apps which need emotion analysis for their operation.

## - 4. AIPoems
In this web app a user can input a theme and then a poem is generated based on the theme and an image as well. The story is generated using ChatGPT and image is generated using DallE.

## - 5. EN2ML
A NLP Project where I convert English Text to Malayalam Audio. Unlike google translate, you can download the generated malayalam audio as mp3 file.

## - 6. AlphaTrip 
AlphaTrip showcases various places in India. The dynamic website was deployed in railway.app. The database I use is PostgreSQL available within railway.app.

## - 7. DhwaniApp
DhwaniApp is a Flutter app that aims towards helping children with special needs in their communication process.
I have worked on the AI-API part of the app and am currently in the process of learning Flutter to work on the app side. 
The app is currently under development.

## - 8. ParkzyAPI
Parkzy is an idea where our main aim was to make parking in the cities easier. As of now, I made an API using the Django REST Framework that inputs an image and reads the license number from the license plate in the image and returns it. This is just one module of the many we are planning to integrate into the app. The app is under development.

## - 9. ChadBot
ChadBot is a discord bot which is mainly built as a way to interact with APIs from discord. Currently it uses: Zenquote api to send a quote, API Ninjas api to send a fact, ChatGPT api to chat and generate poems/stories and DallE api to generate images.

The command to send a random quote is -inspire and to send a random fact is -fact.

To chat with ChadBot (aka ChadGPT lol) you can use: "ok chad" followed by your sentence. The response is generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. To generate a story and a poem you need to use "story:" and "poem:" respectively followed by your theme you want the text generation of. Along with the text, a DallE generated image will be shown which is relevant with the theme.

Update: Now you can generate songs and articles as well using "song:" and "write:" respectively followed by the theme.

If you want just an image, then use "imagine:" followed by the image you want of.

## - 10. PlotIt
A Data Analysis Project powered by python's own Matplotlib library.
